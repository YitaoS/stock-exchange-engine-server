# stock-exchange-engine-server
This GitHub repository contains a c++ based asynchronous stock exchange server using Boost.Asio, a powerful asynchronous I/O library that utilizes the proactor pattern.

We use as little as pessimistic lock as possible to enhance the performance.

run ```sudo docker-compose up``` to start the server.
