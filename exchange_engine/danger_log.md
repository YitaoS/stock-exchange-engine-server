Memory management issues:
The shared_from_this() function is used several times in the code to create shared pointers to the current object. However, it is crucial to ensure that the object remains alive for as long as the shared pointers exist. Otherwise, the program may crash due to memory errors or undefined behavior.
When meet situations where the client sends a invalid request, or the target server sends a invalid response, a response is needed to be created 
and passed to the client. However, the server cannot create a request in a method and use the async_write function to send the response to the 
client, because when calling the asynce_write function, the created request will go out of the scope and be automatically destructed, which caused NPE.

Program attempted to use destroyed lock:
Description: During execution, the program attempted to use a lock that had already been destroyed. This caused unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.
Steps to reproduce: Unclear, as the issue occurred intermittently. However, it seems to be related to concurrent access of the lock by multiple threads.
Impact: The issue could lead to data corruption or loss of data integrity, depending on the context of the program.

Exception handling:
The try-catch block used when we are trying to execute insertion qeury to the database, the following block is supposed to catche all exceptions and sends a bad response to the client. However, it is essential to handle exceptions more specifically and provide appropriate error messages to the client to help diagnose the issue.

Lack of input validation:
The handle_command() function does not validate the input received from the client. This may lead to various issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting attacks.

Lack of error handling:
Several functions in the code use the fail() function to report errors. However, it is essential to handle errors more specifically and provide appropriate error messages to help diagnose the issue. Otherwise, it may be difficult to troubleshoot and fix errors in the code.

Relase of row-level lock in SQL:
When we apply the "FOR UPDATE" row-level lock, we are supposed to release the lock as soon as possible when finishing the transaction. However, sometimes we forgot to use "COMMIT" to release the lock, hence resulting lower performance in handling the request.
